 ============ Pseudocode ===============
    Inputs: 
        Form data text input
        drop-down sorta menu --> will be using materialize's select class
        Submit button

    Output: 
        In the API route, each person will be pushed into an array. 
            
            var person = [ 
                {
                name:
                photo:
                scores: [0-9]
                }; 
            ];

        A module of this array will have to be exported

    Server (This current file):
    ================================
        Express App setup: 
            app and port variables
            app setup to handle data parsing

        Data

        Router: Gives the server a route to travel to when users visit or request data from various URLS.
        Port listening: starts the server
        
    ====================
    Routes (Within same folder of this file):
    ==================
        public directory : 
            home route:
                It's the homepage.
                It has a button leading to the survey
                At the bottom is a list of links leading to the api and githbu repo
            
            survey route:
                It has a floating button which sticks at the lower right so you can go to the home html at any time.

        routing directory: 
            api route
                requires user data
                spits it the response out as a JSON
                handles what happens when the user visits the page (get)
                handles user input data via post requests.
                
            html: 
                html route dependencies: var path = require("path");
                    path package needed to get correct file path for html

                The html routing function is exported as a module with GET requests for the instance of express that's running.

                Purpose of html routing directory: 
                    handles when users visit a page and shows html page of content
                    What's needed: 
                        GET request with ('path', function (req, res)) {
                            res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "../public/reserve.html"));
                        }
                    What's going on:
                        2 arguments are being passed in. A path to the current directory name and a function taking in requests and response from the user.
                        When the user makes a GET request, the server takes the response and redirects the user to the appropriate html file.                    
            
    
    Post
